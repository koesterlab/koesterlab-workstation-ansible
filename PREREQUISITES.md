# prerequisites

When starting your machine for the first time you can simply set it up with the regular windows installer that should show up by default. Before installing fedora make sure to remove the bitlock from the windows partition under the point _security_ in the windows system menu. After that install fedora by creating a bootable hard drive e.g. a usb stick using the [fedora media writer](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download).

If the installation was successfull you can continue setting up your machine by installing ansible with `sudo dnf install ansible` and following the guide in the [README.md](README.md) file.
